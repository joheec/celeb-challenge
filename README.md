Spiceworks Celebrity New Hires
Modify the included project to match the mockups. Feel free to use the included 3rd party libraries if they are useful to you but please don't add any others.

Task: Create this page

Details:
Only needs to work in the latest version of Chrome.
Things should line up and look symmetrical but please don't bother measuring. Just estimate heights, widths, padding etc.
After adding a new celebrity, page should look like this: 
Don't worry about persistence or AJAX or anything like that.
Cards should occur in the order of addition with newest being at the top-left.
Don't worry about form validation, the photo is optional.
The hover state for a card should look like this (top-left card): 
After clicking the X as shown on hover, the card should be removed from the page, and the other cards should fall into place.
Photo URL can be to any image on the internet.
Don't worry about proportionate scaling, just force it to a square.
If no photo is provided, the default image (included) should be shown

Additionally, please answer following:

Q: What would need to be done to make this an actually useful app?
A:If there was a way to make the data persist, like adding a database. Adding the ability to edit a card, and adding a check to the photo url. Make it more robust by adding a login, making it a community, this way adding features like commenting and uploaded by make sense. Additional features include responsive styling for web and mobile.
Would you mind taking a this brief survey after completing this? There's only one question, and it won't affect your chances of future employment with Spiceworks.

Q: What did you think of this test?
A: I think it's appropriate for front end development. A good exercise to see a little bit of everything such as seeing how someone would set up a grid in css, appending elements to the dom, adding event listeners and etc.
